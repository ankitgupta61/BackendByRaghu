Summary of Day 2

unordered lists - cannot count them. It is just a list with items
        <ul>
            <li>item 1</li>
        </ul>

    The items will be displayed in 3 diff types 
        Disc(default), Circle, Square

description lists - key and definition for the key
        <dl>
            <dt>Bangalore</dt>
            <dd>Capital City of Karnataka</dd>
        </dl>

Styles in HTML
=> we use this styles to provide a better User Experience
=> We can implement styles in html in 3 different approaches
    1. Inline 
        - You will provide the style in the line of the tag itself.
        Eg: <p style="color: red;">Hello</p>

    2. Internal
        - you will provide the style inside the head tag of the HTML Document
        Eg:
            <head>
                <style>
                    ---you will declare the style properties here---
                </style>
            </head>

    3. External
        - you will provide the style in a separate css file called as ___.css
        - Then we have to link this file inside the head tag of the HTML Document

        Eg:
            <head>
               <link rel="stylesheet" href="___.css"/>
            </head>

            ____.css
                ---you will declare the style properties here---

Priority/Precedence
First is Inline, Second is Internal and Third is External 

In order to implement the properties on a particulat HTML Element in the Internal or External 
approah we take the help of selectors

Types of selectors
    element selector
        the name of the tag

    Attribute Selector
        class selector = by using the class attribute
                       = you defined with a dot Operator i.e. .
                       = We can add multiple classes to a single element
        id selector = by using the id attribute
                    = you will use a Hash Operator i.e. #
                    = we cannot add multiple ids to a single element
                    = Each id is unique

    group selector = We groupd different tags using a comma Operator and will implement
     the properties as a group

    child selector - Using the space

    Universal Selector - *

    Pseduo Selector - : (explain pending)

how to bring them in center ???

html Vs dhtml ???

<center>
</center>

Block tag - container - wrap the html elements inside it.
    Eg: div, p, h1, section, header, footer, etc...

Inline Tag - It is used to wrap some content from a existing HTML Element. and then we can
implement some css properties on the wrapped content.
    Eg: Span, a, ins, del, mark, strong, etc......

width => x axis
height => y axis
