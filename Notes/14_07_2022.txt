HTML DOM
=> Document Object Model 
The HTML Document is a collection of html elements, These
html elements are represented as objects in a form
of a Model which is a tree like structure

                                             Document
                                               Root
                            Head                                    Body
                            title                             p             h1
                        My First Web Page               Hey I Mars      Jupitor is a planet


<html>
    <head>
        <title>c</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p style="color:red">c</p>
        <h1>c</h1>
    </body>
</html>

const a = "Hello"
para.appendChild(a)

Why we need DOM
    Browsers will display the document to the user

Web Applications
    => Any application that is served on the web 
    => 2 different categories,namely MPA & SPA

Multi Page Applications
=> The page gets reloaded
=> Every time a new request is sent and the data is downloaded from the server again.
=> Bandwidth is wasted
=> Server is overloaded
=> The Browser DOM as a whole is reloaded after every request made by the user
    Eg: Nodejs Website

Single Page Applications
=> The page does not gets reloaded
=> Every time a new request is sent and the data is downloaded from the server again
     but only those data which is changed. If the data is not changed it will not
     downlaod anything
=> Bandwidth is not wasted
=> Server is also not overloaded
=> The Browser DOM as a whole will not be reloaded, But only the nodes which was changed will
 be reloaded after every request made by the user

DOM is used to manipulate the nodes within the tree.
