Input - Computer - Output

Input => Variables/Keywords/Identifiers

 Variables - These are used to provide input to the computer.
 datatypes - These are used to specify the type of input that you are passing to the computer

you have to create some logic/Instructions - Based on this the computer will process the given
input
    logic/Instructions => Operators, Decision Statement and Loops

Variables
=> Variables are Actually a name given to a memory location inside a system
=> Data is stored in the computer's memory
=> These Data are Input.
Syntax:
    ES6 was introduced in 2015

    Before 2015 - ES5 and lowwer versions
        JS compiler is very powerful that it can automatically understand the type of
        data that you are passing !!!!

        var var_name = 123
            123 is the value
            var_name is the name of the memory location -> 123 value is stored here.
            var - keyword which is used to define a Variables

        var is global variable

    After 2015 - ES6 was introduced, they added 2 more keywords which can be used to define a
    Variable 
        let var_name = 123

        let is local variable/Scope Variable/Block Variable.

        const var_name = 123
            No matter what you do, the var_name will always have 123 value.

ECMA - European Computer Manufacturing Association
     - Standard script has to agreed b/w everyone
     - ECMA script or ES or EScript or ECMAs or ECscript

    From ECMA - Javascript was derived
              ES1 - JavaScript Version 1
              ES2 - JavaScript Version 2
              .......
              ES5 - JavaScript Version 5
              ES6 - ECMA SCRIPT 6 - JavaScript Version 6

    From ECMA - TypeScript - JS + ES5 + ES6 +Transpiler(It will convert TS to JS)
        
var var_name = 123  // datatype - Number, Value - 123
    var_name = 456  // datatype - Number, Value - 456 
    var_name = 'Hey I am From Mars' // datatype - String, value - Hey I am From Mars

let var_name = 123  // datatype - Number, Value - 123
    var_name = 456  // datatype - Number, Value - 456 
    var_name = 'Hey I am From Mars' // datatype - String, value - Hey I am From Mars

const var_name = 123  // datatype - Number, Value - 123
    var_name = 456  // datatype - Number, Value - 456   //Error
    var_name = 'Hey I am From Mars' // datatype - String, value - Hey I am From Mars //Error

variable Name Rules
=> Var_name cannot start with a Number
=> Var_name can have number from the 2nd character onwards
    Eg: a123
=> The Var_name can start with _ or $ or character
=> It is Case Sensitive
=> CamelCase Notation is used to declare the variable name.
    firstName, lastName, etc...

Computer - Processing/Computing/Calculations - Machines - Binary Numbers -> only 2 - 0 & 1
